## GRAX Connector Framework

The GRAX Connector Framework is used by all GRAX connectors that need to execute snapshot reports to make them easily done with unified logic. The goal is to ensure that all snapshot logic executed in all connectors is unified to ensure that data experience is the same across multiple mediums. If you are updating the framrwork you must ```npm update``` packages below, test, and validate changes.
